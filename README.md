Growing up in Nova Scotia, Canada, I have always been surrounded and fascinated by nature and the environment. Now, I am exploring this academically as Physical Geography student in my final year at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I am eager to learn about the environment around me and how people interact with it. I believe it is important to approach problems from multiple perspectives, which is why I have decided to additionally minor in economics and geomatics. 

My formal education and work experience have helped me develop skills in GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS), coding (Python, R, MATLAB), Microsoft Suite, and research/statistical methods. These skills complement my theoretical knowledge in hydrology, aquatic science and management, climate and atmospheric change, soil properties, geology, and cartography.

# Projects

## New Ottawa Hospital
This project brought together Canadian census data, road networks, and hospital point data to explore how existing hospitals serve Ottawa's population. This allowed me to identify which areas are relatively underserved. Using location allocation I evaluated potential sites for a new hospital to determine the ideal location for a new hospital to maximize the population within 5 kilometers of a hospital.

## Northwest Passage Development

## Everest: The First Ascent 
This map was created to visually represent Hillary and Norgay’s expedition to a general audience interested in the story of Mount Everest’s first ascent. To appeal to the audience, I wanted the map to remain simple and aesthetic so the map includes only the route, camps, and the summit overlaying imagery of the area. Additionally, there is supporting text to capture the audience’s attention and provide some additional context to help tell the story.

## Declining Sea Ice
This map consists of a depiction of the change in sea ice extent between 1979 and 2019. The intended delivery method is an Instagram post, as such, the map is simple so that it can be easily read on a phone and communicate the point quickly and clearly as people scroll through their feed. The map was created for news readers who are generally educated and knowledgeable about current events such as climate change. This map will be used to inform this audience about the loss of sea ice in the Arctic showing how large areas of sea ice have been lost.
