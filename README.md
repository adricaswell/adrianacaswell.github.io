Growing up in Nova Scotia, Canada, I have always been surrounded and fascinated by nature and the environment. Now, I am exploring this academically as Physical Geography student in my final year at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I am eager to learn about the environment around me and how people interact with it. I believe it is important to approach problems from multiple perspectives, which is why I have decided to additionally minor in economics and geomatics. 

My formal education and work experience have helped me develop skills in GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS), coding (Python, R, MATLAB), Microsoft Suite, and research/statistical methods. These skills complement my theoretical knowledge in hydrology, aquatic science and management, climate and atmospheric change, soil properties, geology, and cartography.
